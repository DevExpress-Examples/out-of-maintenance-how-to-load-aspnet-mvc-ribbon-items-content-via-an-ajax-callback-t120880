# How to load ASP.NET MVC Ribbon item's content via an AJAX callback


This example demonstrate how to load ASP.NET MVC Ribbon item's content via an AJAX callback.<br />A div containerÂ with the defined ID attribute is placed in the MVCxRibbonTemplateItem. Then, the content of this container is updated via an AJAX request initialized on a ribbon button click.<br />The pecularity of this scenario is that the new content will not be able to increase of decrease width of a template item because ribbon items have defined widths. These widths should be defined manually or will be calculated automatically on control initialization. So the MVCxRibbonTemplateItem's width should be fixed.
